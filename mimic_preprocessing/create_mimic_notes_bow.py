""" Convert the notes in the NOTEEVENTS table to categorized bag-of-word
representations for each episode.

**N.B.** This processing includes one filtering step (Step 4) which is specific for
the 2-day prediction task.

This entails five steps.

    1. Remove stop words, stem, etc., each note. This does not require any
       synchronization steps.

    2. Create a CountVectorizer across all of the documents which converts
       tokens to indices.

    3. Transform each note to a bag of words.

    4. Combine the bags of words for each category and each episode. This step
       also filters notes which occur more than args.episode_length after the
       annotated beginning of the episode.

    5. Convert the combined representation to a sparse (row) matrix for each
       episode. This step also joins all of the notes for each episode and
       filters those which occur.

The output is a data frame with one column giving the HADM_ID and the rest with
the concatenated bags of words for each note category.

Please note, this script was compiled from multiple jupyter notebooks, so it is
not particularly efficient. Apologies in advance.

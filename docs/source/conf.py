# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file does only contain a selection of the most common options. For a
# full list see the documentation:
# http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/config

###
# CUSTOM AUTODOC COMMANDS
#
# This conf.py file also adds a few custom autodoc commands. While these have
# been somewhat tested, they are all a bit hacky. User beware.
#
#   * `autoclass_docstr_only`: This can be used to show only the docstring for
#       the following class. Presumably, this is used at the top of the
#       documentation when the class is just introduced. In particular, this
#       also suppresses the name of the class. Example usage:
#
#       ```
#       .. autoclass_docstr_only:: aa_encode.aa_encoder.AAEncoder
#       ```
#
#   * `autono_docstr_text`: This can be used to suppress the docstring for
#       the following class. Presumably, this is used when giving the method
#       definitions for a class. Example usage:
#
#       ```
#       .. autono_docstr_text:: aa_encode.aa_encoder.AAEncoder
#       ```
#
#   * `:exclude-members: module_doc_str`: This option can be used to suppress
#       the module-level docstring for a module. This is again intended for
#       use in the "Definitions" section after the module has already been
#       introduced. Example usage:
#
#       ```
#       .. automodule:: aa_encode.utils
#           :members:
#           :exclude-members: module_doc_str
#       ```
